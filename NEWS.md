ceterisParibus 0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------

* The `ceteris_paribus()` function from ver 0.2 is now avaliable as `what_if()`. Here is where the development of older version will take place.

Major refactoring of the code
----------------------------------------------------------------

Please note, that `what_if()` and `local_fit()` functions are	remainders from version 0.2 and they will be deprecated in version 0.4. 
They will not be avaliable in version 1.0. 
From version 0.3 the recommended way to create explainers is through the function `ceteris_paribus()`.

Please note, that `plot_interactive()` function will be deprecated in version 0.4.
It will not be avaliable in version 1.0.
